Mayavi: 3D Visualization and Plotting with Python
-------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   Mayavi_ is an open source, Python package for general-purpose 3D
   visualization. It is built atop VTK_ and provides a Pythonic API. Mayavi
   provides a standalone application for visualizing data but more importantly
   provides a convenient high-level library for 3D visualization. The library
   integrates well with the Python stack and interoperates well with NumPy
   arrays. Mayavi provides a simple yet powerful entry-point for scientists via
   its ``mlab`` module which is somewhat similar to what ``pylab`` does for
   matplotlib_. Due to its use of VTK, Mayavi supports image data, structured
   grids, polygonal data, and unstructured grid datasets. A variety of
   visualization algorithms can be applied to data. Custom user interfaces that
   embed Mayavi plots can be easily made and these can also be embedded into
   larger GUI applications that are written in either wxPython or Qt. Mayavi
   also has some preliminary support for embedding interactive 3D plots inside
   Jupyter notebooks. In this chapter we introduce the reader to the Mayavi
   library by considering a simple application. We demonstrate how one can use
   the library to start with exploratory analysis, polish the visualization,
   animate it, and finally build a simple customized GUI application using the
   libary.
