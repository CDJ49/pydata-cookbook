Mayavi: 3D Visualization and Plotting with Python
-------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   Mayavi_ is an open source, Python package for general-purpose 3D
   visualization. It uses the powerful VTK_ library and provides a Pythonic API
   to it. Mayavi provides a standalone application for visualizing data but more
   importantly provides a convenient high-level library for 3D visualization.
   The library integrates well with the Python stack and interfaces seamlessly
   with NumPy arrays. Mayavi provides a simple yet powerful entry-point for
   scientists via its ``mlab`` module which is similar in spirit to matplotlib's
   ``pylab`` module. Due to its use of VTK, Mayavi supports image data,
   structured grids, polygonal data, and unstructured grid datasets. A large
   number of visualization algorithms can be applied to data. Custom user
   interfaces that embed Mayavi plots can be easily made and these can be
   embedded into larger GUI applications that are written in either wxPython or
   Qt. Mayavi provides basic support for embedding interactive 3D plots inside
   Jupyter notebooks. In this chapter we introduce the reader to the Mayavi
   library by considering a simple application. We demonstrate how one can use
   the library to start with exploratory analysis, polish the visualization,
   animate it, and finally build a simple customized GUI application using the
   libary.
