.. class:: abstract

MPI for Python (mpi4py) is a package that provides Python bindings for the
Message Passing Standard (MPI) and can be used to employ parallel and high
performance computing with core packages of the PyData stack. It includes
convenient communication methods for any pickable Python object as well as
efficient communication methods for buffer-like Python objects via the the
standard Python buffer interface (such as NumPy arrays, PyCUDA GPU arrays, or
selected built-in types). In this paper, we show easy to follow examples and
applications that use mpi4py to speed up the calculations of core packages of
the PyData stack.
