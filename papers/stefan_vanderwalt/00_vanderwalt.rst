scikit-image: image processing in Python
----------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

    scikit-image is an image processing library that implements algorithms 
    and utilities for use in research, education and industry applications. 
    It is released under the liberal Modified BSD open source license, 
    provides a well-documented API in the Python programming language, and is 
    developed by an active, international team of collaborators. In this 
    paper we highlight the advantages of open source to achieve the goals of 
    the scikit-image library, and we showcase several real-world image 
    processing applications that use scikit-image. More information can be 
    found on the project homepage, http://scikit-image.org.
