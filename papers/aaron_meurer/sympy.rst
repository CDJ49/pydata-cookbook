SymPy

.. class:: abstract

   SymPy is a symbolic mathematics library written in pure Python. It is a
   full-featured computer algebra system, including functionality for symbolic
   calculus, equation solving, symbolic matrices, code generation, and much
   more, as well as several domain-specific modules including statistics,
   quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics. In this chapter, we give an
   introduction to symbolic computing and the SymPy library, and show through
   an example how it can be used as part of a larger scientific workflow.
